-- DDL for a Basic Invoice Management System
-- This schema defines core entities for managing invoices, customers, products, and invoice line items.
-- 
-- Normalization considerations:
--  - The design adheres at least to 3NF:
--    * Each table represents a distinct entity with non-redundant attributes.
--    * All non-key attributes depend on the primary key.
--    * No transitive dependencies exist.
--  - Referential integrity is enforced with foreign keys.
--  - Invoice line items capture many-to-many relationships between invoices and products.

-- -------------------------------------
-- A. Basic invoice management system
-- -------------------------------------
-- Table: invoices
-- Stores invoice header data.
-- Each invoice is linked to a customer and includes invoice date and status.

    invoice_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    invoice_number VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL, -- custom invoice number if needed
    customer_id INT NOT NULL,
    invoice_date DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
    due_date DATE,
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Pending',
    total_amount DECIMAL(12,2) DEFAULT 0 CHECK (total_amount >= 0),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
        ON DELETE RESTRICT
        ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

-- Table: invoice_items
-- Stores line items for each invoice.
-- This table resolves the many-to-many relation between invoices and products.
-- Contains quantity, price at the time of invoice, and line total.
CREATE TABLE invoice_items (
    invoice_item_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    invoice_id INT NOT NULL,
    product_id INT NOT NULL,
    quantity INT NOT NULL CHECK (quantity > 0),
    unit_price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL CHECK (unit_price >= 0), -- Capture price at time of invoice
    line_total DECIMAL(12,2) AS (quantity * unit_price) STORED,
    FOREIGN KEY (invoice_id) REFERENCES invoices(invoice_id)
        ON DELETE CASCADE
        ON UPDATE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
        ON DELETE RESTRICT
        ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

-- ----------------------------------------
-- B. Additional tables that might be needed
-- ----------------------------------------

-- Table: customers
-- Stores information about customers.
-- Each customer has a unique ID and identifiable details.
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    first_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(20),
    address VARCHAR(255),
    city VARCHAR(100),
    state VARCHAR(100),
    postal_code VARCHAR(20),
    country VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Table: products
-- Stores product information with unique product IDs.
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    unit_price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL CHECK (unit_price >= 0),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Optional: Indexes for performance (could be added as needed)
-- For example, index on invoices.status or customer_id for faster queries.
CREATE INDEX idx_invoices_customer_id ON invoices(customer_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_invoice_items_invoice_id ON invoice_items(invoice_id);
