## Ratio1 Platform Overview

Ratio1 is a decentralized platform aiming to be the "AI supercomputer for everyone," powered by distributed edge computing and blockchain technology. Ratio1 provides an "AI Meta Operating System" that transforms everyday devices into intelligent, revenue-generating compute nodes in a global network. This allows developers, businesses, and contributors to run AI tasks across a distributed network of nodes. By leveraging blockchain for transparency and tokenization, Ratio1 democratizes AI computing - users can deploy AI applications at scale, and node operators earn rewards for providing compute power.

$R1 Token: The Ratio1 ecosystem is fueled by the R1 utility token, which is used for all transactions and incentives on the platform. Consumers of AI services pay for processing jobs and resources with R1, and providers (node operators) earn R1 in return for contributing their computing resources. The R1 token is strictly a utility token (not a speculative asset or security) - it carries no ownership or voting rights, and serves purely as a medium of exchange within Ratio1’s network. This token mechanism ensures that the platform’s economy aligns with usage: those who need AI computation buy R1 to pay for jobs, and those who run nodes receive R1 for their work.

$R1 Supply: The maximum theoretical supply is 161,803,398 R1. However, it’s highly unlikely we’ll ever hit that number due to node license (ND) sales (20% of R1 paid is burned), AI services on the network (15% of that payment is burned) and the tiered Node system that limits inflation.

The name Ratio1: Ratio1 is inspired by the Golden Ratio (~1.618). This string of numbers appears as an easter egg throughout the project, symbolizing the natural flow and cohesion of the ecosystem.

## Node Deeds (ND), Master Node Deeds (MND) and Public Sale Details

A Node Deed (ND) is an NFT-based license required to operate a Ratio1 Edge Node (i.e. to contribute a device’s computing power to the Ratio1 network). Owning a Node Deed gives the holder the right to run the node software, participate in the decentralized compute ecosystem, and earn token rewards for supporting AI tasks. Each ND license comes with an allocation of 1,575 R1 tokens as a base reward, which is released gradually over a 36-month period (this is part of Ratio1’s "Proof of Availability" mining incentive). In addition to this fixed emission, ND owners can earn extra R1 through "Proof of AI" (PoAI) mining - meaning they receive rewards for actually processing AI jobs on the network (performing useful work).

ND Public Sale: The first public sale of Node Deeds starts on the 24th of June 2025. The sale uses an anti-inflationary tiered pricing model. There are 12 price tiers (T1-T12), each with a limited quantity of Node Deeds available. The price begins at $500 for Tier 1 and increases at each subsequent tier as lower-tier units sell out. All prices are listed before VAT, and applicable VAT will be added at checkout based on the buyer’s country (tax jurisdiction).

Tier 1: Price $500 (USD, excl. VAT) - 89 NDs available
Tier 2: Price $750 - 144 NDs
Tier 3: Price $1,000 - 233 NDs
Tier 4: Price $1,500 - 377 NDs
Tier 5: Price $2,000 - 610 NDs
Tier 6: Price $2,500 - 987 NDs
Tier 7: Price $3,000 - 1,597 NDs (~1.6k)
Tier 8: Price $3,500 - 2,584 NDs (~2.6k)
Tier 9: Price $4,000 - 4,181 NDs (~4.18k)
Tier 10: Price $5,000 - 6,765 NDs (~6.77k)
Tier 11: Price $7,000 - 10,946 NDs (~10.95k)
Tier 12: Price $9,500 - 17,711 NDs (~17.7k)

Each tier’s supply count is derived from the Fibonacci sequence (e.g. 89, 144, 233, …, 17,711 are consecutive Fibonacci numbers). In total, 46,224 Node Deed licenses will be available through this sale (the sum of all tiers). Once a tier’s allotment of NDs sells out, the price moves up to the next tier. This model helps ensure a fair distribution and aligns the price with demand, rewarding early participants with a lower price and mitigating inflation of the licenses.

Purchase Limits: To promote decentralization (and avoid a few buyers accumulating too many nodes), Ratio1 imposes purchase caps per buyer. An individual purchaser (after completing KYC verification) can buy at most €10,000 worth of Node Deeds, or the maximum number allowed in the current tier - whichever is lower. For example, in Tier 1 an individual is capped at €5000 (the Tier 1 cap, which equates to 10 ND licenses at $500 each). The per-person limit increases in higher tiers (Tier 2 cap €15k, Tier 3 cap €30k, and Tier 4 and above cap €200k), but the €10k KYC limit still applies if lower. Similarly, a business entity (after KYB verification) can purchase up to €200k worth of NDs or the tier’s max cap, whichever is less. These limits ensure no single individual or company (especially large "whales") can corner too many Node Deeds early on. Note: All buyers must undergo email verification and KYC/KYB checks (per Anti-Money Laundering regulations) before purchasing, and certain jurisdictions are prohibited from participating due to compliance restrictions.

A Master Node Deed (MND) is a special license allocated to early contributors (seed investors, team members, key partners). MNDs generally have larger token allocations but they are not transferable (you can’t trade or sell them; they’re bound to the owner). MND holders also often run oracle nodes that help secure and coordinate the network. The MND token release is on the sigmoid vesting curve we discussed (slow, then fast, then slow). These Master Node Deeds also do not have the ability to perform "Proof of AI" (PoAI) tasks in the network, earning rewards only from "Proof of Availability"(PoA).

Node Deeds summary: In summary, ND = public, tradeable, smaller fixed mining rewards per license. MND = private, non-tradeable, larger and slower vesting rewards, often tied to running core network services.
